# TODO App
Hello! This is a demo app for the lab in COSC 381!

## Changes in main.java
- Added functionality to manage Todo items with descriptions and due dates.
- Implemented methods to add and display Todo items.
- Resolved merge conflicts between `add-todo` and `add-date` branches.

I am almost finished! Yay!
